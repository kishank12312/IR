# WebGraph-PageRank-and-HITS

This repository has two python code files ``` pageRank.py ``` and ``` hits.py ```.

Part A: **Web Graph Page Ranking**
This aims at implementing the PageRank Algorithm from stratch. 
The algorithm is implemented with and without teleportations using numerical linear algebra package and **Power Iteration Method**
We are taking the teleportation value as 0.1.

Usage: 
Run ```pageRank.py``` to run the program. 

The program allows user to enter the query in form of a graph. The user is expected to enter the number of nodes and if the user wants a edge between 1 and 2 then he should enter ```1 2``` when prompted for the edges.

```Functions and their uses:```

The webpage ranks are calculated through the following methods:
1. Numerical Linear Algebra Package: This method uses the linear algebra package in python to calculate the left eigen values and vectors
2. Power Iteration Method: This method uses power iteration with a precision of 1e-8, and a max iteration limit of 500 to calculate the values.


Part B: **Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS) Algorithm**
This aims at implementing the HITS algorithm from stratch.  
The dataset is a Directed NetworkX Graph with web content (string) saved in a GraphPickle (web_graph.gpickle) file which needs to be loaded in the python runtime. You will need to install this library (if not already installed) by ```pip install networkx``` in the command prompt.

Usage:
Run ```hits.py``` to run the program.  

The program allows the user to enter query for which they want hubs and authority scores.

The program finds a **root set** containing the nodes from the web graph which contains the query word. The program further finds the **base set** which contains all the nodes which are linked to the nodes in the root set.
The program runs the HITS algorithm on the webgraph/matrix made by this base set and outputs the hubs and authority score of the webpages in the base set.
